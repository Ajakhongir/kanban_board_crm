KANBAN BOARD APP INTRODUCTION

The KANBAN BOARD APP is a task management tool that helps users keep track of their tasks and manage their time effectively. The app provides a visual way of organizing tasks using a Kanban board, where tasks can be moved between columns representing different stages of completion, such as To-Do, In Progress, and Completed.

Users can sign up, log in, log in with Google, and log out of the app. Once logged in, they can add, edit, and modify their tasks as needed. The app features a stopwatch that is active when a task is in the In Progress stage, allowing users to easily track the time spent on a task. Tasks can be moved back to the To-Do stage at any time, pausing the stopwatch.

The KANBAN BOARD APP also allows users to export their tasks as a CSV file and share it with others, making it easy to keep others informed about the progress of their tasks.
